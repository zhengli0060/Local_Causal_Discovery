# 🌟 Local Causal Discovery

Welcome to the **Local Causal Discovery** project! This repository is dedicated to exploring causal discovery techniques. It provides tools and code for:

- 📊 **Simulating Data**: Generate data from discrete or continuous models based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs).
- 🕸️ **Random DAG Generation**: Create random DAG structures for experimentation and analysis.
- 📂 **Working with `.bif` Files**: Load, manipulate, and generate Bayesian network data using the `bnlearn` library.
- 🧪 **Conditional Independence Tests**:
    - 🔗 **d-separation**: Test independence based on graph structure.
    - 📊 **G² Test**: Perform (conditional) independence tests for discrete variables.
    - 📈 **Fisher's Z Test**: Evaluate (conditional) independence for continuous variables.

## 📦 Dependencies

This project leverages the following libraries to ensure robust and efficient operations:

- 🛠️ **`pgmpy`**: A library for probabilistic graphical models.
- 🕸️ **`networkx`**: For graph-based operations and visualizations.
- 📊 **`bnlearn`**: A library for Bayesian network learning and data generation.

✨ **Stay tuned for updates** as we continue to expand this project with more advanced techniques and tools for causal discovery!
