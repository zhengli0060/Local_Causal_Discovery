    Generator of Erdos-Renyi directed acyclic graphs.

    This class is a wrapper of the Erdos-Renyi graph sampler of the ``igraph`` Python packege.

    Parameters
    ----------
    num_nodes: int
        Number of nodes.
    expected_degree: int, default None
        Expected degree of each node.
        The value provided must be greater or equal than 1.
    p_edge: float, default None
        Probability of edge between each pair of nodes.

    min_num_edges: int, default 2
        The minimum number of edges required in the graph.
        If 0, allows for empty graphs. The maximum value allowed
        is ``num_nodes * (num_nodes - 1) / 2``, corresponding to a DAG
